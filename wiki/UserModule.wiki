= Open points =

  * When deleting a user, the message should be: "This will remove the user "username" permanently. Do you want to continue?"
  * The confirmation message should be: "The user "username" has been removed from the list of users. 
  * When adding a new user group or language, don't show pop up messages that the data has been inserted
  * It should be possible to mark multiple groups or languages at the same time when choosing
  * On the user account request page, the user should be able to apply for group privileges and languages by choosing one or more from a list
  * upon request and login of an administrator, the user request should appear on the admin's log in screen, clicking on the user request will open the user module
  * the user module should have the possibility to filter the users by not active and active users and new user requests (this should still be a different status), i.e. we have user status 'active', 'not active' and 'new user request'
  * for new user request, there shall be a box, where the admin can see, what languages and groups the user has applied for (in order to help him assign)
  * see the user registration workflow file below in the Links section for details
