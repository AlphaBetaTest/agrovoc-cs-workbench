#summary To keep track of who is doing what and how we do things.

= Working with the issue tracker =

The owner is the reporter of the issue (this doesn't change)

Once, somebody picks up the issue to work on it, you change the status to "started" and put your name in the cc field (you can do this)

Once you fixed the issue, you change the status to "Fixed".

Then Margherita or Boris will check on the online version, and if we are ok with it, we change the status to verified and the issue is closed.
