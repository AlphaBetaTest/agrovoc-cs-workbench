Current tested ST version is 0.8.6. Note that this is being tagged as 0.8.6 on the ST project site: https://code.google.com/p/semanticturkey/.
You can just download it and run: "mvn clean install" on the project (providing maven in installed in your machine).

P.S: even the current version on the trunk (0.8.7-SNAPSHOT) works as well since there is no difference from 0.8.6 except for the new project version.
